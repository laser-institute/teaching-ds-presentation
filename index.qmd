## Discussion

- What challenges do you face teaching data science?
- What challenges do (your) potential learners face?

---

## Student Barriers

Educational researchers face challenges:

- **Ethical considerations:** Privacy and consent
- **Access limitations:** Computing resources 
- **Technical concerns:** Coding anxiety

::: {.callout-note}
These barriers require thoughtful instructional design
:::

---

## Research Questions

**RQ #1:** What backgrounds, motivations, and fears do students bring?

**RQ #2:** What pedagogical approaches build confidence and competence?

---

## Study Overview

- **44 doctoral students** in education
- **2 one-day workshops** using R and RStudio Cloud
- **Pre/post surveys** + qualitative analysis

---

## Student Assets

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**59%** had relevant degree

**57%** had work experience
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**77%** wanted new skills

**75%** wanted job-relevant skills
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Students aren't blank slatesâ€”build on existing knowledge

## Technical Anxiety is Real

**84%** cited technical factors as primary concern

> "I really do not understand the statistical stuff. I might as well be reading Russian."

> "Some of the programs, such as R, are a little intimidating."

## Confidence Growth

::: {.columns}

**3.35**  
Pre-workshop

::: {.column width="33%"}
**4.65**  
Post-workshop  
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
**+1.30**  
Increase
:::
:::

Statistically significant improvement on 7-point scale

::: {.callout-warning}
**Note:** Troubleshooting confidence didn't improve

## What Worked: Pedagogy

**66%** cited pedagogical factors as workshop strength

**Key strategies:**
- Patience and flexibility  
- Collaborative coding  
- Normalizing errors  
- Plain language explanations  

---

## Student Feedback

> "It was helpful to practice... I really appreciated when you explained what the code was saying by reading it out loud."

> "[The instructor] made a 'bunch of numbers' actually mean something."

## Five Evidence-Based Guidelines

Research-based recommendations for instruction

---

## Guideline 1: Build on Prior Knowledge

Connect computational methods to existing research experience

**Avoid** assumptions about starting knowledge

---

## Guideline 2: Use Educational Data  

Start with familiar contexts:
- Student assessment data
- Survey responses  
- Grade books

**Not** generic datasets from other fields

---

## Guideline 3: Connect to Research Practice

Explicitly link techniques to:
- Educational research questions
- Students' work contexts
- Real applications

---

## Guideline 4: Create Supportive Environments

- Normalize debugging process
- Model problem-solving  
- Maintain patience with difficulties
- Make errors learning opportunities

---

## Guideline 5: Balance Instruction & Practice

Structure lessons with:
1. **Demonstration**
2. **Collaborative work** 
3. **Individual application**

Avoid extended lectures

---

## Key Takeaways

- Students bring valuable experience
- Technical anxiety is addressable
- **Pedagogy matters more than software**
- Confidence can grow substantially

---

## Discussion

- What resonates with your teaching experience?
- Which strategies will you try first?  
- What additional challenges do you face?
