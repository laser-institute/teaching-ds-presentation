## Purpose

-   To *discuss* the challenges of teaching learning analytics to
    newcomers
-   To *summarize* some research on this topic
-   To *share some strategies* for teaching newcomers (or planning
    courses for newcomers)

## Some research

![](images/design and effects.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Questions

**RQ #1**: How do educational researchers in a doctoral program situate
themselves with respect to data science?

**RQ #2**: How did the design of the workshop help educational
researchers overcome barriers to using data science?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Overview

-   **44 doctoral students** in a general educational research doctoral
    program
-   **2 one-day workshops** using R and RStudio (Posit) Cloud
-   **Pre/post surveys** + qualitative analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Students want to code!

-   Around 75% of students said they were learning R because they wanted
    to use R/coding in their work or for their doctoral program

## Students have some anxieties

- **84%** cited technical factors as primary concern

> "I really do not understand the statistical stuff. I might as well be
> reading Russian."

> Although having two degrees in mathematics-related fields, my
experience with true data analysis is limited. As a classroom teacher, I analyze student data regularly, but rarely (really, never) with advanced statistical analysis

> I am fearful I will not have enough time to fully understand the programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Confidence Growth

- Students grew in confidence, even through a brief (one day) workshop

- What Worked: Pedagogy

**66%** cited pedagogical factors as workshop strength

**Key strategies:** 
- Patience and flexibility\
- Coding together
- Normalizing errors\
- Plain language explanations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Student Feedback

> It was helpful to practice what we were doing together so we could ask questions of each other. I also really appreciated when you explained what the code was saying be reading it out loud.

> Although, I didn't understand many things, [The instructor] stayed positive and never made me feel less intelligent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guideline 1: Tailot to students' backgrounds

- Don't teach a course for _other_ students -- get to know yours!
- Explicitly and deliberately build confidence
- Do this through pedagogical strategies and a supportive attitude

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guideline 2: Use Familiar Data

Start with familiar contexts: 

- Student assessment data 
- Survey responses\ 
- Gradebook

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guideline 3: Emphasize relevance

Explicitly link techniques to: 

- Educational research questions 
- Students' work contexts 
- Real applications

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guideline 4: Create Supportive Environments

-   Normalize debugging process
-   Model problem-solving\
-   Maintain patience with difficulties
-   Make errors learning opportunities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways

-   Students bring valuable experiences
-   Technical anxiety is addressable, but it requires explicit attention
-   Pedagogy can matter greatly!
-   Confidence can grow substantially, even over a short period

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

- At some point in the future, what do you hope to teach regarding learning analytics?

- What challenges do you anticipate -- learning-related, related to your institution, etc.?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Micro-Support

- You'll next see 5 different problems novices may face with R/R code
- Your task in groups is to briefly discuss what you could _say or do_ (including nothing!), and prepare one strategy to share

Here goes!

```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(2025)                                # for reproducibility

student_data <- data.frame(
  id     = 1:20,
  name   = paste0("Student_", 1:20),
  gender = sample(c("Female", "Male"), 20, replace = TRUE),
  score  = round(runif(20, 60, 100), 1)       # 60â€“100, one decimal
)

# Derive letter grades
student_data$grade <- cut(
  student_data$score,
  breaks  = c(0, 70, 80, 90, 100),
  labels  = c("D", "C", "B", "A"),
  include.lowest = TRUE,
  right   = FALSE
)

student_data
```

## Problem 1

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
student_data <- read_csv("student-data.csv")
studnet_data
```

## Problem 2

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
glimpse(student_data)

filter(student_data, scores > 70)
```

## Problem 3

**"I'm totally lost. I can't get my code to run, my data is ruined, and our pet's heads are falling off!"**

## Problem 4

*str_detect() is a function from the `stringr` package*

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
str_detect(student_data, gender, "Female")
library(stringr)
```

## Discussion

-   What resonates with your teaching experience?
-   Which strategies will you try first?\
-   What additional challenges do you face?
